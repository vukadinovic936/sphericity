# Survival Analysis

1. Cox.ipynb will help you prepare the data before running survival analysis, select field identifier for the condition for which you want to run the analysis (example: "131338-0.0" for cardiomyopathy)
2. Run Cox/Run_Cox.R to get the hazard ratios
3. Run Cox/Plot_Cox.R to make survival plots split in three groups. You can specify the name of the preprocessed csv file and modify the y axis by changing the line 50.
